        The goal of the NumberPartitioning problem is as follows (quoted from
        [Lucas]): 
            
        Given a list of N positive numbers S = [n1, . . . , nN], is there a
        partition of this set of numbers into two disjoint subsets R and S âˆ’ R,
        such that the sum of the elements in both sets is the same?
        
        Note that if we can't do this partitioning, then the next goal is to
        find a partition that almost does this, ie a partition that minimizes
        the difference in the sum between the two partitions.
